 * This is an express middleware that ensure the DB Connection is ready before
 * passing the request forwards to the next handler. You can use this at the app
 * level, or with any specific Router() block to make sure mongo is available
 * 
 * We implement this as middleware, rather than doing it during application boot
 * so that the app will be up and ready to receive requests as soon as the
 * process starts â€” the first request will be handled more slowly, but
 * we'll have great service availability.
 * 
 * We also get resilience to DB connections being dropped, because if they fail,
 * this middleware will re-establish them for us on the next request
